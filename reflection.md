This project features a simple research partnership matching application platform. University and Industry R&D players will get the chance to link up in research, funding and implementing projects in existing applicable domains. Partnership is allowed between universities, between industry players and most importantly between universities and industry players.
I have used chatgpt to discuss the feasibility of techstack to use, which given the timeframe of the project I chose the NextJs recommendation. Chatgpt also gave me a mindmap to follow in building the whole project.
For enhancements, I have used tray to add docstring documentations where the ganerated code and my own code did not include them. 
I have used coderabbit for feature enhancements after several reviews.
Though I have not completed the project to suit my intended needs due to time factor, I am glad AI has made me achieved what I achieved in the shortest possible time frame. 
Debugging particularly is super-easy with the use of AI tools, the bugs that in the past will take days to fix now take seconds.
The major challenge I faced using AI tools is the need for subscription, free tiers tend to keep one stuck and switching to another platform compromises the memory and context a tool has already been using. The AI tools work best when they are paid for.
In conclusion, while AI blends and simplifies develoment, it does not replace human capabilities in any way. AI only make developers highly productive, gives better understanding of concepts by fetching documentations and simplifying them and much more.
